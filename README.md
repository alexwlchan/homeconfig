# junkdrawer

This repo is a collection of things that don't have a better place to go.
Dotfiles, scripts, Dockerfiles, config, and so on.

The name comes from [@betsythemuffin](https://twitter.com/betsythemuffin/status/1003313844108824584):

> Underrated programming techniques: name something (a step definitions file, a class, a directory, whatever....) "junk drawer."
>
> Not "util" or something else that kind-of means "junk drawer" but pretends to dignity.
>
> Be bold. Admit what you're doing. Do it with joy.
