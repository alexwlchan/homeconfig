# junkdrawer

This repo is a collection of things that don't have a better place to go.
Dotfiles, scripts, Dockerfiles, config, and so on.

The name comes from [@betsythemuffin](https://twitter.com/betsythemuffin/status/1003313844108824584):

> Underrated programming techniques: name something (a step definitions file, a class, a directory, whatever....) "junk drawer."
>
> Not "util" or something else that kind-of means "junk drawer" but pretends to dignity.
>
> Be bold. Admit what you're doing. Do it with joy.

**Nothing in this repo is documented or supported.**

It's a collection of stuff that's useful for me, but not necessarily anybody else.
If I thought something was useful enough to be worth documenting or supporting properly, I'd put it in its own repo.

Pick through what you find here, but don't be surprised if it's hard to follow or seems odd.
It made sense to me when I wrote it (probably), that's it.
