# dreamwidth_rss

This directory contains a script for making an RSS feed from my Dreamwidth Reading Page.

It's a bit of a hack -- it pretends to be a browser, logs in to Dreamwidth, then creates an RSS feed from all the entries from my friends.
The resulting feed only includes links to the main posts -- so you still need to log into Dreamwidth proper to see the post content.

You probably shouldn't use this.
