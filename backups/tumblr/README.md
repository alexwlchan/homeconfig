# backup_tumblr

This code has graduated!

In the wake of Tumblr's new content moderation policies and the widespread deletion/banning of comments, I put it in a standalone repo with some documentation so it'd be easier for other people to use.

It now lives at <https://github.com/alexwlchan/backup_tumblr>.
