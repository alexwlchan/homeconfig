# dockerfiles

This directory contains Dockerfiles for Docker images that I find useful.

Often I'll run programs in Docker (which makes installation much easier on a new machine) than on the host.

This is especially useful for software which is installed with tools I don't usually keep handy, e.g. npm or golang.
Because I'm not a JavaScript or Go developer, I don't have those set up on my machine, and I don't want to set them up for a single tool.
Docker works as a handy stopgap!
